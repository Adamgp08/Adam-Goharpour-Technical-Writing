About Me
=======
Hi, my name is Adam Goharpour
<p>
I am an experienced and versatile professional with a multidisciplinary background in project management, human resources, and education, skilled in creating clear and concise technical documentation. Throughout my career, I have been developing process manuals, workflow documentation, and compliance materials. Some of my work includes writing manuals and SOPs on operating telehealth equipment and software, safety checklists, on site task verification SOPs for construction installers, and quick-step guides for software and document handling procedures.<p>
With 3 years of overseas teaching experience, I have worked closely with educators, to develop English language assessments, and reading, writing, listening, and speaking exercises. As an Assistant Language Teacher in Yamagata City Japan, I have provided language instruction and coaching to children, teens, and adults. My work also included research and writing covering various current events and technological innovations around the world.<br>
I continue to study, research, and add to my skills through projects, developing new training documents, technical guides, reference sheets, and other creative multimedia content.
